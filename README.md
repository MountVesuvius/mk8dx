# Mario Kart 8 DX - Project


This project WIP project is a collection of tools, and data visualizations surrounding Mario Kart 8 Deluxe.

## Segments
### Tools
- [x] Kart Combo Randomizer
  - [x] Show kart stat totals
  - [x] Images for individual items
- [ ] Kart Builder
  - [ ] Select any part from any category
  - [ ] Compare 1 build to another

### Data Visualization
- [ ] World Record History for every track
  - [ ] Display as line chart
  - [ ] Toggle 150cc & 200cc
  - [ ] Interact-able data points for further detail

## Note
Currently the site CSS is a little bit hacky, as I'm focused on functionality over aesthetics.
Want to use this as an opportunity to learn more about Tailwind or Pico CSS once things have been built.
